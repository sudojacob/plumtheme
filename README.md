Plum theme for OPNsense

Credit to remic-webdesign@chello.at because I just took the tukan theme and changed some hex codes.

Download the repository, take the plum directory and put it in /usr/local/opnsense/www/themes/ on the opnsense machine.
Then refresh opnsense and select the theme on the system->settings->general page

I decided to enable ssh on opnsense and then use rsync.

Also for some reason it sometimes takes a bit for changes to show up, if that happens, just keep using the firewall and it should change eventually.
